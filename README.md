# React Server Side Rendering Example Code

This is the companion repository for the React Server-Side Rendering from Scratch article.

## Getting started

Fork and clone the git repo locally.

Then install the dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

Starting the react server

```shell
npm start
```

Starting the mock API server

```shell
npm run api
```

## Note - This repo has some extra code like the modal. This is because in the future component-centrie code splitting will be added on top of it

## To be added

Code-splitting using React-Loadable (both route-centric and component-centric).
